AndroidHybridDemo
=================

An Android implementation of mobile Gap app using web views.

This app leverages the responsive web site developed by Skava at http://m.skavaone.com/

The purpose of this app is to demonstrate and determine the level of effort to develop our own native/hybrid mobile
apps at GID.  Reusing the responsve web site from Skava is simply a convienence and is not intended to imply
a long term solution.  GID is in the process of making our own responsive site and this would serve equally well with
this solution as does the Skava site.

See the current Gap mobile apps developed by Skava which are avaiable at Apple App Store and Google Play sites.

In the meantime, for demoing purposes and learnings, the Skava assets will be used.  Skava also provides a JSON
payload of navigation elements (button images, menus and brand URLs) which is avaiable here:

Work which is still TBD:

1) Add brand top banner over the app's view.  Currently current brand scrolls off the screen.

2) Scan tab functionality is not implemented.  Add native camera support.

3) Currently store locator is not functioning.  Maybe more location permissions are necessary?
